summary text: Izod Makes Great Jeans
review text: Izod did it again! This time they made a great pair of jeans in an understated manner. They fit perfectly and are also very roomy with space to spare. The fabric has a nice soft feel but holds its form very well. And they didn't seem to shrink after one washing (and I know I didn't lose any weight!). These jeans can be worn on special occasions as well as for physical activities. I love them and couldn't ask for anything more. Also the price is fair and probably hard to beat. Try a pair. I think you'll be delighted. Lastly they are well packaged and arrive on time. A hard act to beat.

summary text: A Solid Fairly Priced Tee Shirt
review text: This was a very good purchase. The material is both soft and strong. It fits well with plenty of room. It holds its shape well and even comes with a handy pocket in front. They appear to be made to last because they seem very durable. As if these were not sufficient
reasons to buy these shirts, the price is very good and fair. I recommend these Tee shirts, even for all year round wear (layered).

summary text: To Iron or Dry Clean is the Question
review text: The company is reputable and they make a good product. The material is soft and the workmanship seems quite good; these are not pants that were "thrown together". They are also very comfortable even at the end of a long day. The only minor fault is they don't seem to be wrinkle-free. I know I could wash them, dry them for a few minutes, and" iron " if needed but I prefer to take them to the dry cleaners. I still highly recommend them particularly for the comfort factor.
